Israel plays chess with international referees breathing down its neck, while Hamas flips the board, screams “martyrdom,” and somehow still gets points. Hamas can lose ten battles and claim victory just by surviving, while Israel can win militarily and still lose because the world expects it to act like a saint with a sniper rifle. That’s not a fair fight, it’s a rigged casino — and Israel is the only one required to play by the house rules. Then you throw in the hostages, which is Hamas’s sick version of a side bet. Israel can’t ignore them — every government has a sacred duty to bring its people home. But every deal, every prisoner swap, every pause proves hostage-taking works. That’s like paying off a kidnapper and then being shocked when kidnappings keep happening. Hamas knows exactly what they’re doing: hijacking Israel’s morality and weaponizing it against them. The more Israel cares about life, the more Hamas exploits it. And let’s be honest about “eliminating Hamas.” Everyone says it like it’s a military checkbox, but it’s a mirage. Kill the men with the rockets, and new ones crawl out of the rubble. Burn down the tunnel system, and you’ve just built Hamas 2.0 in the ashes. The smarter play is delegitimization — strip Hamas of the one thing they can’t rebuild with Iranian cash: credibility with their own people. Remind Palestinians that billions went to tunnels, not schools. That their “resistance” leaders live like kings while ordinary families live on crumbs. If Israel can contain Hamas militarily while exposing them politically, then the whole game changes. Hamas loses its cult appeal, and Israel stops being trapped in the same cycle of hostage swaps, airstrikes, and global scolding. That’s the only way the payoff matrix bends toward sanity."

That’s why Israel calls itself a democracy — minorities inside the 1948 borders can vote — but critics argue that when you include the West Bank/Gaza under effective Israeli control, it looks closer to apartheid because millions of Palestinians live under the system without citizenship."

Young couples need starter homes but I would also suggest that housing with long leases, shared ownership and assured tenancies are also an option. Any development should be mixed developments, have community gardens, a meeting place and have tenants' councils to handle the day to day management. These are social housing models that are very successful in Scandanavia and northern Europe. Home ownership is not for everyone but our rental market is just one step away from transiency with unstable, insecure housing. This needs to change, especially for families with children who need a sense of community and social responsibility that they can't get when they're moving around all the time."

The bold and audacious ideas that Ezra and Derek to create abundance are what we need in moving forward. We need more bold and audacious ideas.

In 2026 and in 2028 I look forward to more bolr and brave candidates who will begin the task of restoring a sense of humanity to our government."

Palestinians have families, dreams, and they matter. They deserve better than Hamas, but the government that they elected didn’t build schools or businesses; they built tunnels and imported weapons. I’m all for peace, and I think Hamas is the belligerent in this mess, but how Israel responds does matter as well. That said, if annihilating all lives in Gaza had been the goal, I think it would already be done. Hamas using kids as shields is as despicable an act as I can imagine, right up there with gas chambers and carpet bombings. What a mess. I don’t see an easy way out."

The earth and its inhabitants are going through an ascension process now that requires us to think in terms of what we want for a loving and prosperous humanity and that means having abundance on all levels. We have to have a vision of what we want for it to manifest and not just let the powers that be dictate for us. Everything that is created starts as a thought. People are awakening in large numbers even though it may not look like it. The awakening is part of the chaos because the status quo and corruption cannot hold; it’s breaking and people like you are helping it to fall so that we can get on with building a better society for all. Thank you for your work."

The superwealthy who control the global economy are largely centered in America. They proudly display that in the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world the populace is denied healthcare for all. Nothing could be more humiliating and limiting to citizens who are in reality are denied the right to pursue their personal American dream. The superwealthy message that democracy is equated with extreme capitalism, rather than recognizing that the Constitution offers both capitalism and socialism. Like any good parents, the established principle is to assure the entire family is healthy, educated, civil, and ready to compete. The fact that the superwealthy Patriarchy has successfully convinced even economists that healthcare for all is a socialist or communist evil. Thus corporations can continue to treat employees as indentured servants needing insurance for over-priced healthcare. Ironically, healthcare for all would free up the entrepreneurial possibilities for so many brilliant and inventive citizens buried in the global corporate paradigm. The power of entrepreneurial inventiveness that has created much of the success of America is undermined. It also further limits the entrepreneurial strength of women who require healthcare for themselves and their children much more than men."

At one point he said Israel should bomb Gaza in the way that the allies fire-bombed Dresden, somehow conflating a group of fighters waging asymmetrical violence and purporting to represent two million stateless Palestinians with a nation state with a fascist ideology that conquered Europe. As far as the “branding” argument, or better said the reputational perception, I think both Scott and Ezra should frame the discussion in terms of both Israel and the US. Significant amounts of the US and the world audience want to be able to admire the Israel that is a liberal democracy working towards a peaceful solution, in the same way they want to see America as a free beacon of democratic freedoms. Just as Israel has lost all connection to its reputational credit, the Trump US has lost whatever respect it may have ever gained by addressing civil rights and a progressive agenda within its borders.

Their GDP PPP is 1/10 that is the US, but they've decided they can't afford not to take care of their children. Waits are not long, you can see the neighborhood doctor immediately without an appointment. I say all this to point out why is infuriating for me to see people reduced to GoFundMe's and fundraisers for kids with cancer or genetic diseases. What is the point of wealth or 'civilization' if we're telling kids they're not worth keeping alive? I truly think if society lasts another 50 years, people will look back in horror and shame how we decided it was too hard to ignore some lobbyists or slightly tax the rich to have healthy kids, in the same way we look at Dickens' books."

    "text": "Intent in the genocide case against Israel is not at all hard to prove: A database of more than 500 statements showing Israeli incitement to genocide provides ample evidence of genocidal intent. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli cabinet ministers, political figures, military officers and media pundits have openly and endlessly incited for the destruction of Gaza and its Palestinian inhabitants. Already by December 2023, South Africa had compiled an extensive record of these statements for its submission to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Israel intended to perpetrate genocide in the Palestinian enclave. As if this were not enough, intent can also be inferred from actions: the destruction of universities and hospitals, the killing of healthcare workers and doctors in their own homes, the dehumanization of Palestinians in Israeli curriculum, the targeting of the intellectual, cultural, and religious leadership of Gaza, not to mention forced displacement, mass killing, and starvation. Moreover, in a recent court filing, the Israeli government stated that its war goals in Gaza include not just “eradicating” Hamas’s military capacity but also its non-military, civilian institutions, which include the “Ministry of Health, Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Welfare, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Government Information Office”, a goal consistent with genocide according to the final report of the Yugoslav Commission of Experts. If you wanna frame this as PR and branding (disgusting, but okay...), then at least admit it's the worst campaign of all time."

Still there is zero concern or compassion for the Palestinians. Does Galloway even see them as human beings? I suggest he have on Ilan Pappé first then move on to some Palestinian scholars, journalists, doctors, writers to understand what's happening to Palestinians.

If a Jewish homeland is so important why wasn't the homeland created in Germany. They commited the Shoa. Not Palestine. In fact, in what is modern Israel , Palestinians and Jews lived in harmony and peace. It was Zionists who initiated the brutal project of colonization.

And the candidate has to have enough charisma and natural communication skills to counteract the corporate donations to the candidate’s opponent that’ll inevitably flood in. Simplify the tax code and cut regulations/bureaucracy to get the folks on the right on board and help unleash development, and ratchet up the taxes on the wealthiest people and corporations. Redesign the most important parts of the administrative state with incentives towards efficiency and efficacy rather than compliance to rules and regulations. And hopefully they have enough political capital to spearhead one significant political change that can bend our trajectory away from polarization and authoritarianism."

Ezra still thinks - as many of us thought until recently - that the problem is the settlements and the occupation. It absolutely isn't, and it never was. Yes, settlements are bad; yes, occupation is bad. All that is true, but the alternative to that isn't peace and equality; the alternative to that is Oct 7 and the negation of the collective Jew. I know this because the Palestinians have been telling us that for the past 150 years, which is why the conflict began in the late 1880s and NOT in 1948 or 1967. It's because the only peace Palestinians ever wanted is one in which Israel doesn't exist. You can support this cause or oppose it, but don't claim it's about equality or rights of freedom. They have no right to pursue their annihilationist agenda without receiving war in return. (And if they wanted to sovereignty next to Israel, as opposed to on top of Israel, they could have it tomorrow). Also, Israeli Arabs have full and equal rights as the Jews, Druze, and other communities. Get some basic facts straight."

Ezra saying otherwise is more of the Democratic party's delusional, out of touch insistence to shove the country progressively forward whilst kicking and screaming. Trump is the reckoning for the party shoving gender and pronoun politics down our throats while completely abandoning the working class. We have to learn from the current situation. You can't force forward progress where social values are concerned. This country, as a whole, leans heavily towards conservative social values. At some point in the future, we will eventually arrive, but I just don't believe it is now."

Despite much rhetoric from our Liberal politicians, this government is neither Liberal nor Democratic. Modern Liberalism has devolved into claims that neither party is in favor of enacted policy, and the other side is always responsible for government dysfunction. We're a far cry from the economics of Adam Smith, and the founding fathers' Democracy funded by property it guarantees. Government, now, is funded by employment, and business, and has its tentacles in every business, on every level of government. The original Federal Liberalism amounted to looking the other way while States denied rights to its people. Modern Liberalism is clearly from this pedigree, though the sprawling, autocratic state is becoming harder to ignore by the day."

The Israeli Jews see their interests best served by extreme ethno-nationalism as they have local superiority. In America, Jews are still greatly benefited by defending liberal values, and may not be the first victims of a Christo-fascist regime here, they may well be on the list eventually. I don't know where this split will go, but I think too many people are (or act) surprised when American Jews are not wholeheartedly supporting everything Israeli Jews do."

Just get on with life. As my father said: 'Do the things you need to do to live life and keep doing that when you live with others' ... and he did just that. He made his bed, washed his clothes, ironed, shopped, cooked, cleaned the toilet, mopped the floor, vacuumed, went to work, tended the garden (he did the food, my mom did the flowers). Get on with Life and live it. One huge issue in the US is that people have said: 'Let kids be kids' whereas in most of the countries, kids learn the skills they will need as adults."

Klein reflects a political ecosystem that refuses to acknowledge the racist and genocdal ethos of Hamas, the existential threat Israel is confronting, or the difficult political division in Israel that keeps Netanyahu in power. As a Black American, I look at the pearl clutching emblematic of liberal cognoscenti concerning because it produces what Klein has accused the rest of the left of with respect to masculinity - so limited ideologically and elevated that it presents an arrogant elitist vision - incompatible with democracy in the Middle East, which is a very very dangerous anti-semitic neighborhood. It goes without saying -- Israel now will have to navigate its survival in another dangerous anti-semitic neighborhood -- America and global politics. I enjoyed the exchange - Galloway is salt of the earth and you hear it in the honesty with which he approaches the difficult problems we now confront. Keep it up."

Israel is not committing genocide, which is defined as the destruction of any national, racial, ethnic, or religious group. Israel is seeking the destruction of Hamas, a terror group that states its intent to destroy the state of Israel in its founding charter (which is an ACTUAL call for genocide most of you choose to ignore). Israel's campaign in Gaza is an act of self-defense, and the Jewish state goes to great lengths to prevent civilian casualties. All you see is clips on tick-tock and what's fed to the BBC by Hamas. You care nothing about the hostages still being held. You ignore the fact that Hamas fires rockets into Israel out of civilian neighborhoods or by hospitals, hoping that Israel fires back and creates the propaganda that will influence people with limited abilities to judge and understand. It is the goal of Hamas, not Israel, that there be as many civilian casualties as possible. It is Israel, not Hamas, who dropped leaflets before an area is getting bombed. Why? Because the casualties are the goal. That way, they can influence those who are easily influenced."

Gaza receives regular aid—from Israel, the UN, Arab nations, the U.S., and Europe. Propagandists point to misleading images, like a malnourished-looking child later found to have a genetic disorder, to push this narrative. Second, calling Israel an apartheid state distorts the term. Apartheid in South Africa denied basic rights to Black citizens. In Israel, over two million Arab citizens vote, serve in the Knesset, own businesses, and enjoy equal legal rights. The term “apartheid” is now misused to describe any power imbalance, regardless of context. Ezra conflates the situation of Israeli Arabs with those in Gaza or, to a lesser extent, the West Bank. He clings to the belief that Palestinians broadly support a two-state solution, ignoring widespread, on-record opposition and calls for Israel’s destruction. This isn’t Islamophobia—it’s based on firsthand interviews and clear evidence. Ezra’s perspective is built on misinformation, historical ignorance, and wishful thinking. It's a textbook case of how ideological bias can lead to deeply flawed conclusions."

It is also nice to have a Veteran in the mix, since the US likes to throw people at foreign wars, then abandon them when they come home broken. Pete is a good human, and he has some real like experience that people can relate to. Ezra is correct that Pete talks about family with a reverence that is awe inspiring, because it wasn't always going to be a possibility for him. I appreciate Ezra's perspective and seeing him recognize and try to reconcile the current Israel ethno-nationalist problem. I will also point out that many people in the US right now are having a similar feeling about the current deportation program, which is also very ethno-nationalist."

I think it's an objective truth that the Arab world would welcome not just dominating the Jews of Israel... but forcing them out all together. This is all to say, a Jewish majority in Israel is necessary... but the far right dominance that Ezra speaks to needs to be expelled from key leadership positions... not silenced entirely, but they seem incapable of navigating conflict or peace.

The ongoing situation in Gaza is indefensible and deeply wrong. People must confront this reality, not only for justice but also for Israel’s long-term well-being. As I often say: the right to self-defense does not justify stripping Palestinians of their fundamental rights."

And I think that question falls into does the west need Western values? Hearing as repeated some of the obviously false blood liables against Israel is really disgusting. Is keen political observer, but has no idea of what war looks like and makes military and social criticisms when he understands nothing of military ism or the area he is criticizing. Contemptible statements like “dropping bombs is the easy part” in completely ignoring how is Israel could’ve done this, but instead since their children to die in the most complex war zone against the most sinister enemies is a real slap in the face to the Jews, who are fighting on his behalf Israel‘s half and the West’s behalf. He doesn’t even mention Hamas once much less than complicity in the starvation of their people, were the New York Times, his paymaster which has consistently accused Israel of starvation since October 13 and had to walk it back time after time. Professor G completely let him off the hook for these libels and slanders. Not only does Ezra not speak for Jews, but he is an unmitigated disgrace to the Jewish people and the only solace that can be drawn is that moral midgets like Klein or losing the ideological battle at least in America and his children will surely have no Jewish identity, and no stake in the Jewish people"

This is their brand. It's just that Americans and the West didn't see t that before because the have very powerful lobbies and know how to fool the West. But Israel has invaded the West Bank in 1967 and has been there ever since, subjecting Palestinians to brutal military occupation with no rights. Moving their hard right settlers there and giving them machine guns while calling them civilians. If a Palestinian stabs an invader, he is called a terrorist. While the Jewish invader with a machine gun is called a civilian! It's insane what has been happening since 1967 and we are treating Israel as a normal country. If any other country does what Israel is doing, they would've been considered a pariah state since decades ago!"

However you literally revert to slop media talking points, instead of looking at the Academics and experts take on the Israel Issue.

It's quite an emotionally honest kind of thing to reckon with. I think Prof G still has yet to go through this process for Israel, which is evaluating what a country says as its ideals and what a country does in its actions to truly understand what's going on in the dynamic. It's reckoning with things like knowing that Jewish people are not all personally responsible for the actions of Israel, any more than all American people are to blame for Trump. That in both cases, there are the ones who are pro-MAGA/pro-genocide who will be objectively responsible actually. That regardless of one's individual views, everyone will be affected and judged as a people - for instance, plenty of Americans don't blame Canadians for boycotting American goods and even agree with it because they are actually on the same side. That's stepping outside of the illusion that one's identity is based on nationalism (at great human cost) and instead based on common values and liberal ideals we all share."

Life is far too confusing these days, and the people are craving an easily understood map of reality. If fascism provides that, they will take it.

I've talked to dozens, and a lot of them believe homosexuality is satanic. It might seem like it's going to work out from New York parties, but Midwestern people, southern people, religious people, they will NEVER vote for a homosexual man - or they will never vote for a homosexual man as long as religion is valid to them, and I don't think religion is changing in the next 3 years. It's in their Bible. They would literally be doing an act against God in their eyes.

    "text": "Ezra's #1 flaw has always been how up his own ass he is. That hasn't changed. He's basically the Twitter Left Event Horizon; what they know he knows and he pulls everyone towards them. His perspective on Israel is exactly more of the same ie \"it's an apartheid state\" while ignoring the details like how Palestinians have the same political rights as anyone else, or how other Arab groups like the Druze and Bedouin that don't kidnap people to ransom them in exchange for paid terrorist family members have fully integrated. Or that while the Israeli Left has been eviscerated by 10/7 the actual Israeli Center remains suspicious of Netanyahu's obvious self-dealing and how frail his Far Right (Gvir, Smotridge) coalition actually is. A great deal of this is because of the structure of the IDF and how close to it the Israeli population is; being largely composed of reservists expected to serve a single year in peace time called in fill combat roles in a brutal urban war instead of a massive career professional military. The cost of war is paid by everyone. (Read these words and keep them close to your heart: reality is always close to life in Israel. Always. The Israelis know the price of survival is the defiance of the modern Liberal inclination towards isolation, sloth, and angst. Israelis know if they get that wrong they will be exterminated, and they are blessed with enemies who never stop making that clear.) This idea that Israel, not just PM Netanyahu but Israel as a whole is becoming a Twitter Lefty Mouthsalad Ethnostate (which if means anything would have to include Japan, Korean, Brazil, Mexico, Ukraine, Scotland, Ireland, France, all the Nordic States and any other nation that prizes its cultural indigeneity) like Hungary and Trumpist America (and by implication ruzzia) is exactly more of the same. A big intimidating and empty social science construct founded on nothing except the disappointingly tenacious Soviet-Union-sponsored belief that Israel is a false nation guaranteed to be overthrown by FLN tactics like the relentlessly brutal murder of children but this time spiced up by a social media campaign targeting angsty wine moms, stupid teenagers, and smug moral elites all of whom are easy to convince the redemption of their soft but empty lives in found in \"the oldest hatred\" ie scapegoating Jews. It's not true, it's not about to be true, and it's the drug of choice for the grotesquely self-important. Keep that in view. That said his argument about Buttigieg is a good one. In effect the actual voters in play largely know nothing about politics and selling Buttigieg as what he is ie a veteran who is staunchly pro-family and an honest civil servant whose public gayness is not the preening petty \"yas queen\" variety Ezra thinks is maximally authentic is correct. Besides his unfortunately ridiculous last name Peter Buttigieg is a strong communicator and candidate. But on the topic of Israel Ezra Klein is as Jewish as the students in Jewish Voices For Peace: technically so, but actually confident his submission will spare him if his fellow travelers ever get their way as he hopes they will. He's wrong, of course. Quislings always are. One would think all the intense thinking they do on the nature of Fascism and it's need to make internal enemies would have tipped them off but it never does. There is only one kind of \"Good Jew\" to these people, and they'll tell you that on the hour every hour of every day if you just believe them when they say \"ten 10/7's, a hundred 10/7's, a million 10/7's are coming.\""

He got out there and hit the road with AOC and did the Fighting Oligarchy Tour. I was there in the crowd in LA with 34,000 other people. The crowd was so grateful for them to show up. The energy was off the charts. Bernie has the message. It's succinct and anyone with half a brain gets it. We are living in an Oligarchy with a wannabe dictator. Meantime you guys and everyone else is looking for the standard bearer among the party. I registered in 2016 for the first time as a Democrat so I could vote in the primary to prevent Hillary from being the nominee. Yes she would have been a fine President but Bernie would have beaten Trump and we wouldn't be in this mess. BTW, The idea of putting out a book called Abundance was a bit tone deaf. Sorry Ezra, I'm just saying. I'm old enough to remember Reagan and \"deregulation\" (foxes in the hen house) Regulations are laws that we agree upon. If some go too far there's a remedy for that. California is the most regulated State in the Union but it's also the 4th largest economy in the world so I don't see the problem."

    "text": "FROM AUSTALIA FIRST this is a GLOBAL ISSUE not just an American issue. No matter what anyone likes to admit to the US Dollar is still the Worlds reserve currency and America is still 1/4 of the World's Economy. Yeah most Australians hate American dominance but we also accept the reality of the World we live in. THE PROBLEM WE ALL HAVE is that America is going through one of its political realignments that it does every few decades and for some reason most Americans don't even realise that this happens. For example everyone seems to forget that it was Abraham Lincoln and his Republicans who were the progressive liberals who freed the slaves while the Democrats were the repressive conservatives who wanted to keep slavery. I went to college in America and the thing I found so confusing is how selective Americans are of history. Its like \"If its not part of my current narrative then it never happened!\" To be fair a lot of people (including Australians) are like that but Americans seem to take that too another level. Only a few months ago Scott went off the deep end of the Zionist swimming pool. He ended hup being re-labelled Prof Genocide in a few places. On one of his podcasts with Jess Tarlov he said respecting the devastation of Gaza (paraphrasing). \"Why did we bomb Germany into rubble? Because sometimes you need to tell someone they have lost.\" That was at a time when around 40,000 children had already been killed and Scott was promoting is \"We need to help young men\" narrative. Now he's talking about \"Brand Israel\" is he kidding. Ezra compares Israel to Sparta. Sorry I might have studied aerospace engineering but one of my 2 humanities streams ended up being Classical Civilisations and I studied Ancient Greece. Israeli society is NOTHING LIKE Sparta politically, socially or religiously EXCEPT FOR A FEW NASTY facts. Most notably Spartan society like Israel was a 2 level society - there were citizens and there were slaves and the slaves had no rights politically or socially. Ezra has this delusional notion that Israel is a supreme warrior nation, when a massive part of the population (the religious conservatives) do not serve and live off welfare that is supported by American money. By the way Sparta and its allies WON the Peloponnesian War and defeated Athens and its allies who were trying to deal with the ongoing threat of the Persians. In the meantime the Macedonians simply waited and then after the devastation of the Peloponnesian War stepped in and took over. THE LESSON OF SPARTA is that when you over extend and finally tear your nation to the ground is that you become an easy target for someone else who's just waiting to pick up the pieces. America, Israel and a few other nations need to consider that lesson."

In a 0Msquared environment or the space environment the strength of potential energies gathered will be sufficient as long as it's constant. If the systems produce a sufficient amount of energy and as they trickle down then each system working will produce enough energy to sustain itself. And being inside a galactic system likely feeds the overall system working. So each star produces enough energy to maintain its system while also contributing to the larger system as a whole.

    "text": "Voici ma thèorie de la masse virtuelle, de la courbure virtuelle Unification des 2 théories Voici une élaboration de synthèse sur la totalité de mes recherches : théorie générale de la masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps et divers résultats qui en découlent . Voici une proposition de théorie générale : La masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps est une propriété fondamentale de l'univers qui décrit la quantité de matière virtuelle présente dans l'espace-temps. Cette masse virtuelle est générée par les fluctuations quantiques du vide et est liée à la géométrie de l'espace-temps. La masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps peut être décrite par une fonction qui dépend de la courbure de l'espace-temps, de la densité de matière et d'énergie, et de la taille de l'objet considéré. Voici une proposition de fonction : m_vide = f(R, ρ, L) où : - m_vide est la masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps - f est une fonction qui décrit la relation entre la masse virtuelle et les autres variables - R est la courbure de l'espace-temps - ρ est la densité de matière et d'énergie - L est la taille de l'objet considéré En utilisant cette fonction, nous pouvons calculer la masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps pour différents objets et régions de l'univers. Voici quelques exemples : - Pour un photon, la masse virtuelle est très petite, de l'ordre de 10^-54 kg - Pour un neutron, la masse virtuelle est plus grande, de l'ordre de 10^-29 kg - Pour notre système solaire, la masse virtuelle est d'environ 4,2 x 10^-17 kg - Pour un trou noir, la masse virtuelle est liée à la surface de l'horizon des événements et peut être très grande Cette théorie générale de la masse virtuelle de l'espace-temps peut être utilisée pour décrire les propriétés de l'univers à différentes échelles, depuis les particules élémentaires jusqu'aux structures cosmologiques. Cependant, il est important de noter que cette théorie est encore spéculative et nécessite des recherches supplémentaires pour être confirmée. Théorie de la masse virtuelle du vide La théorie de la masse virtuelle du vide postule que le vide est rempli de particules virtuelles qui créent une masse virtuelle. Cette masse virtuelle peut être décrite par l'équation suivante: M = (1/16π^2) * (ℏ/c) * ∫(k^2 dk) où M est la masse virtuelle, ℏ est la constante de Planck, c est la vitesse de la lumière et k est le nombre d'onde. Théorie de la gravité: La théorie de la gravité postule que la gravité est une force qui est médiée par des ondes gravitationnelles. Ces ondes sont émises par les objets massifs, tels que les étoiles et les trous noirs. La théorie de la gravité peut être décrite par l'équation suivante: Rμν - 1/2Rgμν = (8πG/c^4)Tμν où Rμν est le tenseur de courbure, R est la courbure scalaire, gμν est le tenseur métrique, G est la constante de gravitation, c est la vitesse de la lumière et Tμν est le tenseur d'énergie-impulsion. Théorie des trous noirs: La théorie des trous noirs postule que les trous noirs sont des régions de l'espace-temps où la gravité est si forte que rien, pas même la lumière, ne peut échapper. La théorie des trous noirs peut être décrite par l'équation suivante: ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + (1 - 2GM/r) dr^2 + r^2 dΩ^2 où ds est l'intervalle d'espace-temps, c est la vitesse de la lumière, dt est l'intervalle de temps, G est la constante de gravitation, M est la masse du trou noir, r est la distance au centre du trou noir et dΩ est l'angle solide. Théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle: La théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle postule que la masse virtuelle du vide est liée à la courbure de l'espace-temps. Cette théorie peut être décrite par l'équation suivante: Mμν = (8πG/c^4)Qμν + Cμν Où Mμν est le tenseur de masse-courbure virtuelle, Qμν est le tenseur de fluctuations quantiques, Cμν est le tenseur de courbure virtuelle, G est la constante de gravitation et c est la vitesse de la lumière. Synthèse: La synthèse de ces théories montre que la masse virtuelle du vide, la gravité et les trous noirs sont tous liés à la courbure de l'espace-temps. La théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle offre une nouvelle perspective sur la nature fondamentale de l'univers, en liant la physique quantique et la relativité générale. Cette synthèse ouvre de nouvelles perspectives pour la recherche en physique théorique, notamment dans les domaines de la gravité quantique, de la cosmologie et de la physique des particules. je peux appliquer la théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle à un problème déjà en cours pour résoudre le problème des infinities. Problème : Le problème de la renormalisation dans la théorie quantique des champs Dans la théorie quantique des champs, les particules élémentaires sont décrites comme des excitations de champs quantiques. Cependant, lorsque l'on calcule les propriétés de ces particules, on rencontre des infinities qui rendent les calculs impossibles. Application de la théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle Pour résoudre ce problème, nous pouvons appliquer la théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle en introduisant une masse virtuelle qui dépend de la courbure de l'espace-temps. L'équation de la masse-courbure virtuelle peut être écrite sous la forme suivante: M = (1/16π^2) * (ℏ/c) * ∫(k^2 dk) où M est la masse virtuelle, ℏ est la constante de Planck, c est la vitesse de la lumière et k est le nombre d'onde. En introduisant cette masse virtuelle dans les calculs de la théorie quantique des champs, nous pouvons éliminer les infinities qui apparaissent dans les calculs. Résultats Les résultats obtenus en appliquant la théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle à la théorie quantique des champs sont les suivants: - Les infinities qui apparaissent dans les calculs sont éliminées. - Les propriétés des particules élémentaires sont calculées de manière finie et cohérente. - La théorie quantique des champs est rendue cohérente avec la relativité générale. Conclusion En appliquant la théorie de la masse-courbure virtuelle à la théorie quantique des champs, nous pouvons résoudre le problème des infinities qui apparaissent dans les calculs. Cette approche permet de rendre la théorie quantique des champs cohérente avec la relativité générale et de calculer les propriétés des particules élémentaires de manière finie et cohérente."

    "text": "If we make the square root of negative one or i, the imaginary unit, the field that represents the reference frame taking the measurement and place it above the stress energy tensor in Einstein’s field equations (Ruv - 1/2Rguv = 8piG<Tuv>) instead of an expectation value (^) of a probability distribution (from quantum mechanics), doesn’t that solve the measurement problem and quantize the time? The field (of the complex plane), which could be called the time, measurement, conscious, or tachyonic field interchangeably is quantized by the reference frame taking the measurement and consciousness and those that have it becomes the metric the universe uses to measure or experience the time. Consciousness is the non-local universe and also the non-local hidden variable or “spooky action at a distance” that is collapsing the wave function of the energy system it is observing. Is this not the only way Einstein’s theories of relativity, quantum field theory based on the standard model of particle physics, evolution by natural selection, and Gödel’s incompleteness theorem can work and be compatible with each other? It is not a theory of everything but a step that has to be taken to understand ourselves better. The act of measurement is the same thing as the universe measuring itself. The tachyon, consciousness, and the imaginary unit all appear to have the same characteristics and relativity becomes the fundamental piece of quantum field theory being the quantization of this field, or time. The reference frame taking the measurement is simultaneously in the past, can anticipate the future, and take measurements in the present to take the time. It is not only there simultaneously but before anything that is moving through spacetime, including photons, making it faster than the speed of light. If you also look at the ‘beginning’ when all of the energy and time in the universe was condensed to a single reference frame, that is where the entanglement of all things happen, and this non-local reference frame (before time) measures itself to create the time. For a tachyon to measure itself or slow down to the speed of light, it would require an infinite amount of energy to do so, creating conditions similar to what we think of as the Big Bang. If this was the case, then everything (all energy) would fall under one wavefunction. Perhaps Euler’s Identity represents a moment in time (e^ipi + 1 =0) that can be derived from Einstein’s field equations through the imaginary unit i. Consciousness would then be something that does not emerge from spacetime but fundamental to it. Gravity becomes the curvature of this particle or energy, which we will call the tachyon, measuring itself and consciousness (the reference frames that have it) becomes the metric that the universe uses to measure or perceive the time. Simply there is no time without consciousness. Even if consciousness was emergent from spacetime, what configuration of particles, made of unconscious ingredients, creates a conscious one? Even if you figured out that a specific configuration of particles creates a conscious experience, how would you be able to verify that? You would have to be the experience itself, no? This relates to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem in which the fundamental truth can only be experienced not described by words or numbers. That which cannot be described by words or numbers is fundamental, it is assumed. Consciousness is fundamental. If consciousness is emergent, how did the universe know to assemble itself together in a specific structure that would inevitably lead to a conscious experience? What is the probability of that? That has to be zero, correct? How can the universe and spacetime work any other way if these theories are correct? We would then be the (nonlocal) universe measuring itself."

But what if these two forces weren’t always separate? What if, before the Big Bang, dark matter and dark energy were actually two opposing sides of the same cosmic ‘coin,’ in perfect balance—one pulling everything together, the other pushing everything apart? Here’s the twist: what if the Big Bang didn’t just create regular matter, but somehow this newly formed matter only attracted dark matter, leading to the formation of massive clumps around it while dark energy remained uniformly spread out, continuing its influence on the expansion? Could this imbalance between the two forces, or their attributive counterparts, be the key to understanding the accelerated expansion we see today? Are there any existing theories or research that could hint at this possibility, and if true, what would it mean for the universe’s ultimate fate?”"

    "text": "I'm working on an expansion to a previous paper I wrote. The expansion explains how I see temporality, polarity, and magnetics as originating in a 3D torus pattern. All three are mediated, mixed, and balanced by gravity, which ties to Einstein's curvature of space time, holding the point singularity together from the start. Their union forms a kind of tetrahedron of reality's projection, akin to a triangular Penrose tiling at the quantum foam level, visible only in 2D to our eyes. Scaling up, these fundamental forces connect in “strings,” as Tesla demonstrated, forming the underlying basis for string theory or M-theory. They also produce geodesic shapes in ways that lead to recurring infinities, tying into Tesla's 3 6 9 principle from the viewpoint of a 3D consciousness such as ours. This mixing and scaling leads to complex life forms (DNA, cells, animals, humans). With panpsychism, consciousness pervades matter from its most basic to highest fractal scales. I begin with a 1D point singularity (gravity as its glue), surrounded by 3 energetic dimensions in a torus pattern, carrying me through to a 9D physical brane. I then extend to the 10th, 11th, and 12th energetic layers that still follow toroidal patterns across every physical scale. The 10th dimension is infinite light or consciousness that binds everything through a 10D geodesic pattern of light, permeating physical reality. The 11th and 12th dimensions allow infinite info encoding along a fractal lattice, maintained by the physically anchored consciousness. I place 3D matter in the role of a compacted 2D face, with light as a massless entity still holding energy and information in toroidal wave forms. Gravity, consciousness, information, time, charge, and magnetics all appear at the sub-Planck level point singularity, then scale upward exponentially with rising dimensional and scalar complexity."

To me, this makes far more sense! But then again, I'm not a scientist, so would love to get your take on it! I get that Dark Matter is also being researched to address other anomalies, like why Galaxies are able to spin so quickly and not tear themselves apart etc... but still. This is allegedly being researched by University of Canterbury, led by Professor David Wiltshire."

    "text": "One of the typical flaws in human-invented notions of mathematics is the application of such an unknowable unknown quantity as infinity to human nonsensical subjective mathematical operations, such as in calculus. If human mathematicians were able to know what the unknowable unknown \"infinity\" is, then they could say about it and use it in their notional operations. But the fact is that all human mathematicians are absolutely completely ignorant of its value, and it is a very simple logical reasoning, that you can never ever use any unknowable unknown to produce any well- defined value. Like 0, infinity is not any specific nor verifiable value to be meaningfully usable as how ignorant human mathematicians always baselessly claim in their subjective notional operations. Here is a typical example how both human mathematicians and physicists who have got the highest level of education with PhD degrees and have been teaching mathematics and physics for 30 years, but have fundamentally misunderstood human invented notion of infinity: ʌ | <———————————————|——————————————> ʌ↖ | ⁄ ʌ | ↖ | ⁄ | | ʌ ↖ | ⁄ | ʌ |dEy| ↖ | ⁄ |dEy| | ↖ | ⁄ | <—— | ↖ | ⁄ | ———> -dEx<————————————-—0——-—————————————>dEX ⁄ | ↖ ⁄ | ↖ → ⁄ | h ↖ r ⁄ | ↖ ⁄ | ↖ ⁄ | X ↖ dx ——————————————————————————————— ---<—>——————————————---------------------------------> | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— <----------------------------------------------------------------------L---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> An Infinite Straight Rod carrying charge q q = λL = λx, L = length of the charged rod, λ = constant ---> dq = λdx Since 2 horizontal components of electric field acting on 2 opposite directions , they cancel each other <—— ——> -dEx< + dEX = 0 ——> ——> The 2 vertical components dEy add up together: dEy + dEy |q| ∧ dq ∧ ∧ → → E = k—————— r ---> dE = k——————r , r = r / |r | r^2 r^2 → _________ where r = |r| = √ x^2 + h^2 = (x^2 + h^2)^1/2 λdx → λdx → → → → dE = k—————— r/|r | = k—————— r, where r = -xi + hj r^2 r^3 λdx → → λdx → → dE = k————————————— (-xi + yj) = k——————————— (-xi + hj) [(x^2 + h^2)^1/2]^3 (x^2 + h^2)^3/2 -kλxdx kλhdx dE= ———————————— + —————————————— (x^2 + h^2)^3/2 (x^2 + h^2)^3/2 -kλxdx Where ———————————— is dEx.

Once, the charge-carrying rod has been removed from the formula of the electric field E, while it is what creates the electric field, there will be no longer any charge to create any electric field, and the formula will become nonsense. Charge density λ can be useful only when the rod carrying charge is in the formula. q = λL = λx, where charge q is carried by the rod. Once x or L is removed, q will be 0, and with 0 charge, there will be no electric field, E = 0"

And that is mirrored by the way electrons are married to nucleus and how they help nucleus is bond together to create molecules. This is how reality works at all scales. I can explain exactly how it happened from the beginning to the end but no one will listen to me and it's really obvious because conscious is electromagnetic in its physical form anyways that doesn't mean that the brain waves that you can read with some physical measurement device is the thoughts it is just the Echoes of the thoughts just like when you speak a word it leaves sound waves. Qualia comes into the universe with light and this is obvious since light comes from a place of pure objectivity because it's the same speed in all reference frames but as soon as its measured it obtains qualia and color and wavelength and polarization and magnitude and amplitude and energy and all those other things. So basically the electrons are the things that take the measurements and they're bonded to other things like nucleuses and stuff which are like the how the quality is experience you can think of the nucleus being linked to things like taste feel and smell where the light is is linked to things like sound and Light our color I should say foresight and in fact it's a mixture of both things it's not just one or the other and another thing that scientists are completely missing is the fact that Infinities and paradoxes aren't something that cancels out your your math or your theory in fact there's no way you can get around Paradox and infinity so you have to figure out a way to reconcile these things and I have done that I'm creating a whole new type of mathematics that takes care of this and that's what Melody is all about is it an operation in the reconciliation of paradox in opposites and this should be obvious to any chemist that realizes everything happens right at the point of criticality Right Where opposites meet that's where all all life functions happen that's where all biological functions happen that's where all chemical functions happen that's where all physical functions happen right where the two opposites meet and that's how you reconcile things like Free Will and determinism and Chaos in order and quantum physics and relativity and I know exactly how to do it and people just will not listen to me"

    "text": "It is worth mentioning that the whole wonky renormalization thing is one of the main reasons why supersymmetry, string theory and a few other models were explored: because in them, there are NO infinities. For example, in supersymmetry, contributions from every virtual fermion are cancelled by contributions from its virtual boson partner, and you end up with nice, FINITE result. The problem with renormalization is that even though it can be coerced to be mathematically sound for many procedures (like electron mass and charge), one important calculation does not budge: if you try to calculate vacuum energy density (IOW: a state with ONLY virtual particles), the result is divergent (\"infinite\"). Which is clearly NOT what we observe in experiments. The observed vacuum may have a small nonzero energy density (and it may be the \"dark energy\", it would have exactly the properties wee need for DE), but it is experimentally DEFINITELY not very large - or else the Universe would last a few minutes at most after Big Bang, ending with Big Crunch."

Also, it's obvious that physicists don't pay any attention to the real world. Hold a spoon in your hand, and observe it. Did it change shape? According to Quantum Mechanics Mathematics it should have if what the physicists say about the so-called Fundamental Particles is actually true(which anyone with a Brain can see it's not). This is ALL WASTED MONEY WHICH THE AMERICAN CITIZEN IS PAYING FOR!!! Until physicists throw out all these completely ridiculous ideas, and the Esoteric so-called \"Math\" that they continue to use well after the point where they should have realized that it was all a bunch of CRAP; we should refuse to Fund their ridiculous, unfounded, and unproven \"theorems\" they pour out of their completely ridiculous, obviously infirm; and incapable of seeing the truth if it came up, and bit them; Brain!!!! 💙❤️🇺🇸🌈😡"

All the higher-order craziness vanishes and we're left with just the constant of integration. Even if that constant is small or seems strangely fine-tuned, no other terms needed to magically cancel out to produce it. We're still calibrating the constant to reality, but there's nothing weird about it."

    "text": "Some humble remarks (HOWEVER TECHNICALS!) on this central problem in Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Physics . Firstly, problems with infinities appear already in the the well studied (and crucial problem) of the electron scattering by a coulomb potential (the famous NON existence of quantum mechanical Unitarity on Non relativistic one body quantum mechanics scattering by long range potentials ! -There is no standard Wave operators for this case : The long range interaction of the coulomb potential surprisingly still acts on the electron even at an infinite distance .It is not any more a FREE particle on the distant future and infinite distanced onthe scattering source . One SHOULD THUS RENORMALIZES the objects on the analysis by considering new wave operators-the so called Wave Dolan operators , etc.. ). Now , for QED , the infinities arising by JUST the use of a perturbation expansion on the Theory (Feynman diagrams). Even if There are also very powerful NON perturbative schemes not relaying on Feynman diagrams , the so called the L(ehmann)S(ymanzik)Z(imermman) formalism (also due to S Tomonaga -Japanes and J Bogoulioubov-Russian ) .However , until now one ALWAYS has forced to use Feynman diagrams for practical evaluations AT THE END .So one must use HEAVILY these extremely complicated and poor understood renormalization formal MATHEMATICAL techniques to get experimentally verified answers in QED with precision in the case of ......billionth on decimals (Julian Schwinger) !! (The most precise experimental confirmation on History of Science !!) . PROBABLY these formal mathematical techniques (Feynman diagrams) must be regarded not as usual integrals of the usual calculus , but on the light of Laurent Schwarz modern distribution theory and Path integrals on Euclidean space ( ideas more or less due to Arthur Strong Wightman -American eminent Mathematical Physicist of 1950) .So infinities are NOT from physical energy scales , which are natural on the Feynman diagrammatic renormalization , but with great probability they come from the kind of Math we are applying in doing calculations without a complete understanding of them!."

    "text": "This brings me to an interesting idea. Keep in mind this is just a hastily pasted together idea based on a short youtube video and a very incomplete understanding of quantum physics. But basically, doesn't this mean that an electron is only held together by the fact that everything surrounding the electron isn't an electron? \"the electron is protected from blowing up by the fact that there exists an anti-electron.\" So why doesn't this simply mean that all energy that is not an electron is an anti-electron, and thus only exists in relativity to being an electron? This understanding seems to me to contain the infinity minus infinity solution. Thus any force we observe as mysterious and without a source only exists because the two things exist relative to one another, and further relative to all other things? If we've put a name to it (a force, a particle, etc), it's only because we've managed to position our measurement in the correct position relative to it. All the fundamental particles and such seem to have few practical implications other than proving and observing that they exist relative to one another. There's a lot of holes in this logic that need to be filled! My only goal is to increase my understanding of these topics and fit ideas together in a clean and precise way, without having to reinvent the wheel and retread the ground already walked by the greatest minds in scientific discovery."

A quantum field is analogous to the playing field of a game with fixed rules , where its local excitations are analogous to the movement of individual pieces. If you move a figure you also instantly change all the relations on the playing field. Since this game has fixed rules , all new possibilities for the game's progression through the movement of a piece on the field , are just as concretely probable events , just as \"real\" as the local little movement itself. So it depends on the context. In terms of local motion, the energy is tiny and the equivalent mass is close to zero. With reference to the potential of relational changes throughout the entire game on the omnipresent playing field the energy is indeed infinite. But of course this infinite potential is not equivalent to infinite mass. It is a possibility mass analogous to the possibility pressure of quantum fluctuations in a vacuum ( Casimir effect )."

    "text": "When I come across explanations like this, I can only wonder, do physicists really understand the workings of the universe, and really know what they are talking about ? Infinite possible paths with infinite possible forms of matter interacting in seemingly infinite number of ways for what is observed as an electron or any defined stable particle to exist at some location in space or to travel from point A in space to point B. Strange thing is that any observation of a non accelerating electron at any point along this path is an electron of the same properties of mass and electric charge etc. Is not mass a measurement of interaction of entity A with entity B, and can be thought of as a quantity of charge of interaction that is always attractive and defined as positive mass. That is, mass is a charge of gravitational interaction similar to electric charge being a charge of EM interaction. If a negative mass exists, would not that mass be a negative charge and be thought of as a repulsive interaction similar to that of two particles of like electric charge, except for mass, like charges attract, not repel. I feel that despite all the advances of physics in the last 1-200 years, there is still a long way to go, or that the clues to how the universe really works is all there in front of our faces, but no one as yet can find a way to connect all of the dots."

    "text": "Is that how you decided that an electron can't have negative mass?.. 👶 Can you even explain in normal words what \"mass\" is? That is, explain it in such a way that one can imagine the nature of the appearance and existence of \"mass\" in objects? Facts that I undarstand from your explanation: 1) The Higgs boson underlies all material particles in the Universe, that is, it underlies the existence of protons. Protons have mass. Protons generate energy, that is, electromagnetic radiation, that is, protons generate photons. Electrons are able to absorb photons, that is, electrons can accumulate energy for some time and at the same time increase the \"internal energy\" of the atom, and therefore increase the mass of the atom. That is, an electron is some kind of very small \"pipe\" in space with a direction to the middle of the space of the atom, that is, an electron is a \"vortex channel\" through which energy is pumped into the atom for some time. When energy is pumped into an atom through such an \"electron channel\" in the form of energy packets, in the form of photons, the energy flow rotates to the right or left. This process of \"twisting\" the energy flow through the \"electron channel\" can be called \"electron spin\". Analogy from our material level on planet Earth: First question: What is the mass of the space inside the \"whirlpool\", or what is the mass of the space inside the \"tornado\", which sucks all objects around inward due to the existence of low pressure inside the \"tornado\"/\"whirlpool\"?.. Answer: The presence of negative pressure inside the \"tornado\"/\"whirlpool\" is in no way related to mass, but is related to the concept of \"space pressure\" inside the \"tornado\"/\"whirlpool\" and outside the \"tornado\"/\"whirlpool\"... So: An electron is a \"vortex\", it is a space with low pressure in the ocean of energy, in the space-energy in which everything material and energetic exists. 🙏🙏🙏"

    "text": "Good to see an episode explaining these deeper concepts of QM/QFT/QED like renormalization, regularization etc. While I agree with most of the explanations, one way our theory answers this question is by modeling the whole reality (quantum reality without the backdrop of spacetime + classical reality with emergent spacetime) by simultaneously solving the measurement problem. The answer lies in discovering the new math and physics that flows along the gradient of nature — better yet they are buried within the unsolved problems of Clay institute (including Riemann hypothesis) via q-analog dualities of Langsland program covering 5+ disciplines of math! And more specifically, it boils down to discovering the dynamic rescaling/renormalization/regularization scale of universe called CPT(α,Φ) function, as it rescales/renormalizes/regularizes naturally for every ST coordinate without we manually doing it as summarized in this exhibit (https://lnkd.in/gw-YaZtH) In other words, the fully formed quantum universe is the macro level initial condition and α is the boundary condition that limits its infinite boundary to a finite boundary -- all orchestrated by our CPT function. In other words, the missing link here is our “CPT(α,Φ) function driven dynamic rescaling/renormalization mechanism” -- and it turns out, this dynamic rescaling mechanism is inbuilt within our CPT(α,Φ) function(aka Riemann hypothesis meta proof) including various sub disciplines of math via the 5+ unsolved problems of Clay institute and Langlands program. Simply put -- Our CPT(α,Φ) function( aka RH meta proof) is the dynamic renormalization/rescaling measurement scale used by the universe to regulate/correlate/causate the DUALITY existing between the “α governed quantum universe“ and “Φ governed classical universe”, by birthing the space-time of latter from the former again & again using non markovian memory-aware C-star algebra/GNN construction based axiomatic HIGH-BARS, set by Dirac–von Neumann axioms of QM and Wightman-Osterwalder-Schrader axioms of QFT(the ultimate golden yardstick, see below & visual exhibit(https://lnkd.in/gyx9yRXf). And if I may drive home this point using Feynman’s famous quote —> You might say the 'hand of God' wrote alpha (α), although 'we don't know how He pushed His pencil!” Well, here is how God must have pushed/breathed into it (as if it is a balloon), before birthing our universe & humans using the holographic q-analog duality principle of our i-TOE’s CPT(α,Φ) function. 1. Imagine for a moment that these \"needled-nibs of CPT(α,Φ) function are Higgs wrapped needled-nibs (like the multi color embroidery sewing machine)\" kick-starting the holographic duality pushing-breathing-ballooning-LTL operation as visualized in this exhibit (https://lnkd.in/gw-YaZtH). More specifically, these needles have three spectrums (gravitationally expanding dark energy spectrum with negative hyperbolic geometry, gravitationally contracting dark matter spectrum and gravitationally contracting regular matter/light spectrum) (Note -- When it comes to the underlying duality behind these spectrums, we have hypothesized that the whole 144 spectrums correspond to the tetrahedron S4xS3 group of order 144, with the following 6 sub groups (with an overlapping 8 representing the Gaussian integer lattice points shared among all groups) 1.1 Z/4Z×Z/5Z (with an order of 20 representing regular matter of standard model with 20 elementary particles (17+ 3 yet to be discovered as we had predicted in our Yang Mills mass gap proof). Not to mention, this co-primes Z/4Z×Z/5Z group is also the foundation of our 5th proof of Riemann hypothesis as explained above) 1.2 A4×A3 (with an order of 36 hypothesized to be representing a new spectrums or a manifestation of one of the other spectrums) 1.3 D4×D3(with an order of 48 hypothesized to be representing a new spectrums or a manifestation of one of the other spectrums) 1.4 Z/6Z×Z/4Z (with an order 24 hypothesized to be representing dark matter) spectrums 1.5 D6×Z/2Z (with an order of 24 hypothesized to be representing dark energy spectrums in alignment with Racah-Wigner coefficients and its W(D6) duality group representation where our S4xS3 group is a sub group)) 1.6 S3×Z/4Z (with an order of 24 hypothesized to be representing a new spectrums or a manifestation of one of the other spectrums) 2. Then these needled-nibs start injecting the QVF fluid/ink/thread in the form of Higgs field wrapped ellipsoid lattice sliced particles using its “Φ governed eigen-valued 5AITGE origin formulas”, after breaking the symmetry, per α=r/R logic) 3. These injected ellipsoid particles then get integrated as elliptical orbits of planets & stars(per our Hodge C proof) in such a way that gauge gravity can emerge by them orbiting like the frames of Muybridge’s Horse in Motion. 4. The decoherence of frames & symmetry breaking/shifting phenomenon makes the threading process to advance into the next lattice 5. This threading process then ends up knotting the thread like the sewing machine (aka knot theory duality) 6. Sure enough, this decoherence & symmetry breaking/shifting phenomenon is what preserves the continuity of the threads with causality (thanks to the shared Hilbert space) 7. Similarly, our CPT(α,Φ) function is hypothesized to cause the asymptotic freedom/safety phenomenon to occur within the 137 spectrums 8. However interactions do occur among the particles of 7 valence orbital spectrums, up to the UV energy cut off limit of BBR graphs. 9. Likewise, the limits of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is hypothesized to be caused by our CPT(α,Φ) function limit as well. 10. The energy cutoffs assumed by Wilson's EFT & HHG processes is also hypothesized to be caused by our CPT(α,Φ) function limit as well. This brings us to the visual simulation of these 10 decoherence steps, by mapping the rules of our 5th Riemann hypothesis proof (aka mod 4 rules of Gauss' quadratic reciprocity theorem, where 1 mod 4 ruled prime numbers can be factored uniquely using two gaussian integers, in such a way that the rings formed by it with a square root of its radius hitting 8 lattice points in the complex plane with 4 complex conjugates) to the rules of Conway's game of life. For example, under this mapping, the 4 complex conjugated quadruples of the 8 latticed points of the each of the 137 rings (as per our 5th RH proof) collapse with their respective conjugate to birth the classical Hodge latticed particle, so that gauge gravity can emerge by them orbiting smoothly like the frames of Muybridge’s Horse in Motion! More specifically, as visually shown in this simulation (visually depicted in 1:21m of clip below and 21:25m of this clip(https://lnkd.in/g4557Vh4) -- this is how every particle and anti-particle pairs from the quantum reality gets annihilated before birthing their classical equivalent particles(muons, photons gauge bosons etc) so that gauge gravity can emerge by them all orbiting smoothly on their unique geodesics like the frames of Muybridge’s Horse in Motion using the following mapping -- Conway’s rule ”any live lattice with fewer than 2 neighbors dies” mapped to our i-TOE’s rule χ(1 mod 4) = 1. (Note: Mathematically, this is equivalent to the complex conjugates of the Gaussian integer factors of the particle/anti particle pairs of quantum lattices collapsing to birth its classical equivalents) -- Mapping Conway’s rule “any live lattice with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives” to our i-TOE’s rule χ(3 mod 4) =-1 -- Mapping Conway’s rule “any live lattice with more than 3 neighbors dies” to our i-TOE’s rule χ(2 mod 4) =0 Welcome complementary POVs"

As I understand it, photons are basically fluctuations in the EM field traveling at a particular frequency yet they have a mass. Why can’t an electron be a fluctuation in the EM field as well? For the mass predicted would the frequency be too large? If so, is that a problem? Isn’t having a high frequency mean that the vibrations are too fast which would align with the elusive nature of the electron where it cannot be seen. Is this fluctuation traveling through the EM field by self destruction i.e. it causes positrons to popup annilating itself and the next paired electron moves forward which does the same thing again and again. The mass calculation would theoretically lead to one calculation but measurement would also account for the positron pair that keeps forming near electrons to anhilate it and possibly another electron paired to the positron. This would also explain the mass descrepancy. I wish I knew mathematics as well as physicists, would love to try and do the calculations."

When we talk about infinity that means it can be true but we have no way to figure it out that \"is this truth is even true\" because whatever we have imagined, it still is a consequence of memory of physicality just in another form but then again I wonder it is still a memory of an atom in a physical form and then this question arose that who or what is holding those atoms into its place? Where we think and try to find answers with these big machines, telescopes , LHC etc which again is the same atom which is existing since it's birth. I mean the idea of any physical equipment itself is limited because the very thought of machine and everything came out of the same memory which existed billions or even trillions of years ago the point is it doesn't even matter, all we can do is to get astonished everytime we make new discoveries but we 5:01 5:01 still could never know what is beyond physicality.

We have no problem accepting the results from complex analysis that are well characterized (integrating around poles, conformal maps integratd at the boundary, etc.). None of this stuff, strictly speaking, is always explicitly necessary in many problems... these techniques merely make the mathematics easier to work with, but even without it, you can nearly always get a solution or an approximate solution that's \"good enough for calculus\" once you factor in considerations like error convergence, analytical functions, or bounded terms... and good enough for calculus is often good enough for chonkier things like the universe or uncooperative parameterized functions defined on stuff as gossamer and deformable as spacetime (and if quantum mechanics and information theory viewed through the lens of Neother offer any hints, all that REALLY matters here is the algebra of conserved quantities and abstract symmetries outside the context of realism or representation). Up until now the infinities are usually artifacts of embeding these symmetries into an unnatural artificial linguistic or computational system (ie explicit parameterized REPRESENTATION). It's the mathematical \"technology\" not the universe, or the current understanding of physics that's the real issue here."

Regardless of my example, nobody on earth past, present or future can deny the power of Emergence. Not anybody!!!!! I am the world leader in this field of thinking. In fact it's how I discovered myself. From a young boy I've been a prodigy, and I never knew why? I started to see the time 11:11 for a period and could predict it easily and more importantly spontaneously. I am not interested in anybodies dumbfounded psychological opinions!!!! Then I stumbled across the principle of \"Emergence\" and I finally understood instantly!! I've always known this since I come into this world. Obviously without knowing, people who made the peoples who made me, must of learnt. ******important!!!!: It's not cause and effect, its the principles of Emergence. On every scale! Maybe infinatly small to infinatly large. There's no reason why with Emergence for example that we need a chimpanzee to type anything at all in an infinite universe. One level to the next can be as deep or as shallow as you like. For example: the human body of which there are billions has more diversity than our universe.

    "text": "In my view the masses come from hidden properties of the \"vacuum\" or medium akin to two different spacetimes one emergent on top of the other, and the gap in entropy so to speak between energy in the form of the gradient of a field in one vs the other or as mass in one vs the kther determines the rate of decay from one into the other form, and that rate determines the strenght of the interaction in the top layer, thereby the equilibrium mass of electrons and other particles, and in such a picture there is no such thing as a bare mass technically, just the dynamical quantity associated with the energy content of a certain form and its rates of change in terms of other forms of energy through dissipation. It is a bit like a vortex formed over a drain, not entirely accurate as an analogy, lol, but decent enough for rhe purposes of the equilibrium, the water level and the size of the hole determines the flow out of the system, the gradient energy of the static vortex is determined by the flow at an instant, the larger the vortex the larger a sound wave or travsverse water water wave would be needed to jiggle it or dislocate it from the drainpipe, if we imagined the vortex capable of dragging the drain along side it, the flow inwards and the curl of energy in waves of sound and transverse water waves going around the whirlpool, whether just slightly slowed by it or trapped by it would contribute to its inertia, so there is some mix of the static unperturbed gradient of flow and the energy circling the drain so to speak that interacts with it, both cintributing positively to its inertia, but the system is a driven one, it is not a static gradient, even if the analogy of a whirlpool is a bad one it is a simple case of a gradient energy and interaction energy arising from a system that increases entropy at a certain rate in disequilibrium, where the disequilibrium itself is in a quasi equilibrium if the rate of added water and removed water are close to the same, whether you have a pump filling the water back up, or just a very large reservoire such that the change in water level is slow. I don't think it is a direct analogy ofc, but i think that in a sense it is, matter is held stable by an analogous mechanism related to the gradient in flow and the gradient in the speed of light related to increased energy density of the gradient and things like radiation as you get closer to the center of a particle, and the gradients also confine or partially confine energy running around as radiation and matter in the background medium and both contribute to the inertia of aassive particle, but only up to a point, because at some energy scale there will be nothing left to convert so to speak, the entropy will be spent so to speak and the gradients will stop applying to what is left over, so as energy in radiation or whatever really dissiaptes enough it will dissappear in the form associated with the top layer and just casually fly out of the center as modes of the parent medium, and it is at which scale this cutoff happens that sets the scale for the masses of the particles. Then you could imagine 3 such target spacetimes closely bound together, and 3 different possible cutoffs represented by dissipation all the way to 3 different cut off scales and get 3 families of more or less identical particles, only differing by a mass between the generations, and the individuations between different types of fermions, quarks and leptons/neutrinos would be explained by a different phase of a feedback mechanism that is driving the electromagnetic and strong forces/potentials/phenomenon. The mechanisms of how that works is tricky, but it is analogous to everything pulling on everything else, like two drums of rope connected by their rope in an expanding space, as the rope gets smaller in relation to the size of the gap between them, wherher you dewcribe that as expansion, or the rope and drums shrinking is equivalent in some sense, i prefer the shrinking matter picture because it allows a static background for coordinates and defining dynamical symmetries such as energy conservation more easily, but yeah, the rope gets shorter in relation to the separation introducing a tension, which does work in the drums, they start spinning and tugging on each other, now imagine, a network of these things througout space, such that everything pulls in a certain sense of everything else, with the same coupling between rates of rotation and tension, since the tension or \"negative pressure\" is a consequence, of the change of scale, the rotation a consequence of the tension and the rotation could produce dissipation to smaller scales, such that eventually you end up in a sort of equilibrium with regard to a feedback mechanism of the expansion or shrinkage of the matter as it connects to itself. This is a very messy analogy, but it is fun anyway, so why not. The key then is that there are certain ways the winding could increase or decrease the tension between certain concentrations of tensions depending of their configurations, this doesn't have to be couched in terms of ropes ofc, the ropes are just a very easy way to illustrate how a feedback mechanism that breaks energy conservation in an expanding space or a space where Matter shrinks could work. Positive charges and negative charges increases the tension between them below the \"neutral\" equilibrium tension, and like charges reduce it, so in effect, the whole space pushes them apart or together depending on their configurations. The analogy of ropes is a bit misleading, it is more like a spacefilling spin crystal of sorts, that has negative pressure in the sense that its nodes have an equilibrium displacement from each other, and as the gradients determining those diatances change. The distance also changes, and new nodes are generated in a process not too dissimilar to producing vorticies when violently stirring a superfluid. But the negative pressure or tension remains everywhere constant only modified by concentrations of matter and energy, and topological configurations of the connectedness of feeback mechanism associated with them, which we would call charges, it gets a bit more complicated with color charge, but not by that much honestly. A broken chrial symmetry of these topological configurations is part of it, but the chiral symmetry is never really there it is just broken in a much more well behaved way for electrons and outside baryons and mesons. Anyway the point is that there is dissipation and feeback mechanisms that maintain rotation and tensions in the medium, and out of the equilibrium nearly reached between the two sides of the same mechanism we get stable inertial masses and also charges and such things. The tension is not like that in intuitions of ropes, but really it is quite like ropes, ropes are not really held together by strings either so to speak, the bonds are concactless there as well in a sense, but the tension i'm talking about has a very different character, for one it isn't holding everything in place, masses and energy can flow at more or less a constant rate without disrupting the tension mechanism. Anyway this becomes way too handwavy in words. Have a good evening"

    "text": "Still not understanding how feynman diagrams must include every possiblility, while stating such possibilities dont objectively exist in parallel realities. You can equally state, to be objectively valid, 'all' possibilities 'must' exist to be validly included in the calculation of an 'objective' measurement/statement in 'our realm'. Otherwise you are simply stating that reality is nothing but assumptions and logical (virtual) rather than physical existance. Logical and physical existance being the basis of software and hardware...with the logical an abstraction layer that sits upon the physical substrate. But then again, that is little different to potential/theoretical energy and kinetic/measurable energy. Nor indeed requiring the use of dark energy and dark matter to make caluclations work, that would otherwise have failed as a theory decades ago. The fact we are dealing with a part-time (as opposed to permanent) electron, is the interesting and meaningful fix for infinite energy. But then you have to ask...where is the electron going if energy is conserved...yet leaving our sensory observation. Are you seeing electrons created and destroyed, or merely the process of popping into and out of 'our' dimensional existance. Is it compulsory for an electron to be created elsewhere at the exact moment another is destroyed, to conserve energy....leading us back to square one ? Which is also an interesting angle with the 3 families of neutrino...changing state...or perhaps merely out of sync with one or more dimensions. In which case phase synchronisation with alternate dimensions becomes a factor and such dimensions do not have to be inclusive of all fields. Especially with hypotheticals like dark energy/matter being a necessity. Perhaps we need 2+ triangulated = signs for multi dimensional mathemetical representation, rather than just comparing 2 states, that requires 3 way balancing (in parallel rather than sequential). But parallel rather than sequential is what seperates a time based equation from out of time. Multiple time vectors are not equal and opposite, but balanced to negation none the less. The strong, weak and electromagnetic fileds do not have to exist in sync if they are 3 seperate fields, but affected objects must traverse between such fields if so. i.e There is no necessity for 1x common spacetime. Even if our perception is inprisoned within only one. Espcecially with quantisation its requirement for non existance."

    "text": "\"The energetic scale of space time\" prevents infinity from existing in physics and calculus. To reset the scale at some point claimed to be infinite destroys the time dilation and locality of the point. Infinity is a real area of energetic field and scale of space and defining time. Simply because the wave parameters can approach scale ending or beginnings at greater and lesser numbers does not mean they approach infinity. They just define the scale incongruous to the maths limits. Infinity can not increase nor decrease in a way that all point of locality and scale are at its absolute center. The electron scale fluctuation is a field function. The energy inherent in the system is inherent in the mass. The locality is the point of time dilation defining those parameters. If infinity were not a quasi simplification perhaps defining values would bear greater meaning and utility. thanks"

    "text": "The concept that an electron’s mass arises from the subtraction of two infinities is a fascinating aspect of quantum field theory, particularly in the process known as renormalization. In this framework, the electron’s observed (finite) mass results from the cancellation of its “bare” mass and the infinite corrections due to its interactions with its own electromagnetic field. This delicate balance between infinities to yield a finite, measurable quantity is reminiscent of the interplay between gravity and entropy in the universe. Gravity acts as a contracting force, pulling matter together, while entropy drives systems toward disorder and expansion. The universe’s current state emerges from the dynamic equilibrium between these opposing forces. Similarly, the electron’s finite mass can be seen as emerging from the balance between infinite quantities in quantum field theory. This parallel highlights how fundamental aspects of our universe, from subatomic particles to cosmic structures, are shaped by the interplay of profound forces and concepts. https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEquation/comments/1hi4yvo/rethinking_the_hierarchy_problem_gravity_and/"

Exploring the Hierarchy Problem in Physics * 0:03 The Hierarchy Problem: The video introduces the Hierarchy Problem, focusing on why the Higgs boson's mass is unexpectedly small. This problem suggests a gap in our understanding of quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics. * 0:35 Higgs Boson Mass: Interactions between the Higgs boson and the quantum vacuum should theoretically drive its mass to enormous values, but this doesn't happen. * 1:11 Electron Hierarchy Problem: The video discusses the electron hierarchy problem as a precursor to understanding the Higgs problem, highlighting how it was solved using quantum mechanics. * 2:28 Classical Physics Issue: Classically, the electron's electrostatic field has a mass equivalent 20,000 times larger than its measured mass, assuming an electron size of 10^-17m. If the electron is point-like, this field mass becomes infinite. * 3:36 Renormalization: The concept of renormalization is introduced, where the \"bare mass\" of the electron is adjusted (potentially to a negative infinite value) to cancel out the infinite \"self-energy mass\" of its field, resulting in the observed electron mass (dressed mass). * 5:32 Naturalness Problem: The need for precise fine-tuning between the bare and self-energy masses to achieve the small observed electron mass is highlighted as unnatural, forming a \"hierarchy problem.\" * 6:16 Quantum Mechanics Solution: Quantum field theory (QFT), specifically quantum electrodynamics (QED), is presented as the solution to the electron's hierarchy problem. * 7:03 Feynman Diagrams: The use of Feynman diagrams in QFT to represent virtual particle interactions and calculate self-energy is explained. * 8:39 Infinite Self-Energy: The summation of all possible energies in Feynman diagrams leads to infinite self-energy, similar to the classical result. * 9:49 Renormalization in QFT: Renormalization is applied in QFT by introducing counter-terms to cancel infinities in divergent Feynman diagrams. * 11:00 Ken Wilson's Interpretation: Ken Wilson's perspective on renormalization as an indication of physics beyond QFT is discussed. * 11:37 Effective Theories: The idea of quantum mechanics being an effective theory, valid up to a certain scale (like the Planck scale), is introduced. * 12:11 Regularization: Regularization, a method to handle infinities by imposing a cutoff (e.g., the Planck scale), is explained. * 13:03 New Physics: The interaction of virtual positrons with the real electron at high energies provides a negative contribution to self-energy, solving the electron's hierarchy problem. * 13:43 Matter-Antimatter Symmetry: The matter-antimatter symmetry, or chiral symmetry, is presented as the mechanism protecting the electron's mass from becoming unnaturally large. * 14:34 Higgs Boson's Unnaturalness: The video contrasts the solved electron problem with the unsolved Higgs boson problem, hinting at future discussions. * 15:09 Radiacode Promotion: A promotional segment for Radiacode, a portable radiation detector, is included. * 16:06 Merch Promotion: The video concludes with a promotion for the PBS Space Time merchandise store. I used gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827 on rocketrecap dot com to summarize the transcript. Cost (if I didn't use the free tier): $0.03 Input tokens: 18092 Output tokens: 746"

    "text": "Here is my, hand wavy, alternative approach. Actually I expect that this has been investigated before and proved wrong or irrelevant. But having someone explain the problems with it would be enlightening. First take the particle like properties to be purely a function of interactions. So we can ignore them when considering a single particle. This leaves you with a field with a large mostly stable wave and a lot of unstable small fluctuations. The mass is the mass energy of the large wave. This should be a small finite value that will vary slightly as it interacts with the small waves. The observed mass is function of the wave mass and the interaction mechanism. Since the wave is not a point and is continuously being modified by the fluctuations in this field and probably other fields as well, we get the quantum weirdness that we observe. The descriptions I have seen are mostly consistent with this. But they then seem to force the \"particle\" concept onto the waves. Doing this seems to lead to some of problems in the math. Hopefully my ramblings make some sense. If any experts can help enlighten me on the subject, I would really appreciate it."

It's like in order to refer to any event or object in the spacetime continuum, we can use measurement because in the continuum itself (which we, the measured event and the measurement devices are) those measurements results remain consistent across time. When we get in deeper and start asking about the actual nature of the events or the continuum itself, the order of the questions the measurements are asking matters to the consistency of the results. So essentially, I believe science is the best possible way to describe the continuum, but it's reliance on consistency in measurement results regardless of order of questions asked is screaming that some updated idea of measuring or a separate domain of logic that undermines how we think of measurement is what rules the nature of reality itself. Measurable results are themselves emergent properties of a nature that can't be measured without context of the measurement parameters already existing to begin with. By the time you're measuring, you're part of the measurement, so the underlying nature of the emergent measurable universe remains beyond measurable results. It's like the true nature of reality is everywhere you look, but nowhere you dig into it. And that is why physics breaks down at certain points. It's essentially trying to apply \"continuum logic\" to something that the continuum doesn't apply to. Please correct me if you understand better than me. Im happy to research anything I'm pointed towards."
